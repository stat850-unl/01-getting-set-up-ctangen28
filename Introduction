Hi my name is Cassie Tangen, I am a Nebraska native. I grew up in a small town and spent the majority of my free time with my grandparents on their farm outside of town. I have a BS in Mathematics from Peru State College and a MS in Mathematics from the University of Nebraska Omaha. I enjoy running, hiking, reading, gardening, and playing music. While I am not the greatest musician around, I am good enough to lead worship at a small church in Auburn. I think the main reason I lead worship insted of anyone else is because I'm the only one who is willing to admit to the pastor that they can play an instrument and sing. I have written a few worship songs, but with my busy life lately I do not touch my instruments near enough to write anymore. I am married and I have 3 children. Family is important to me, so most of our free time is spent visiting either my parents or my in-laws. 

I have a modest amount of experience with writing code which dates back to my highschool years. In high school, I took two computer science courses which talk me to use visual basic. While in college I had minimal interaction with any sort of coding language. During my graduate work I used Maple and MatLab a little bit for class, but I did not know how to right my own code. I only modified and used what was provided to me. Once I started my professional career at Peru State College as a faculty member in the Mathematics Department I taught myself how to use LaTeX. I have tabbled in R a bit, but not enough for me to feel like I am particularly great at it.
